Auxillium Magi
=============

Auxillium Magi is a project I began in 2010.  Until this point I had only used C# to make simple college projects, so my goal with this was to push myself and my knowledge of the technology while making a fun game.  I stopped working on it in December 2010 when we started planning First Age Studios, but First Age Studios picked up the title and finished it early 2012.

Auxillium Magi is written in C# using the Microsoft XNA 4 framework.  You can see the game in action and play a demo of the single player mode on the XBox Live Community.

The premise of the game is that you control two elemental mages, each with the ability to block a specific elemental attack.  As the game progresses, there is a wider variety of projectiles, including some that are harmless to avoid but stun you if you block them, arrows that shoot over the shields that need to be shot down with lightning, and combination elemental balls that use both shields.  There are also two boss fights that require the player to reflect attacks.

The full version of the game includes a 2-player competitive mode, in which players can reflect projectiles to their opponent, with each reflection increasing the speed of the projectile.
